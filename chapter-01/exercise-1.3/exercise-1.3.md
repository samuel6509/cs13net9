1. Is visual studio better than VS Code?
    . They both have their disadvantages and andvantages, so i believe this to be subjective

2. are .NET 5 and later versions better than .NET framework?
    . I think that .NET5 and above are better than .NET framework, I believe this because it is now outdated as it only supports up to c# 9
    . .NET framework should only be used to continue support for legact software & should not be used to create new software

3. what is .NET standard & why is it still important?
    . .NET standard was used to allow cross platform capabilities across multiple devices & services, projects had to use this to be cross platform
    . Nowadays, .NET is the successor of .NET standard but it is still important to allow legacy software & services to continue being avaliable

4. Why can programmers use different languages (for example, c#, f#) to write applications that run on .NET?
    . Developers can write in different langauges because .NET is a runtime enviroment rather than an actual programming language 
    . allows devs to write in 3 languages, f#, c# & objective c 

5. what is a top level program and how do you access any command line arguments?
    . top level program means you do not have to write the class initialisation or the main method
    . to acces command line arguments i imagine you would do Console.WriteLine(args) / something like this 

6. what is the name of the entry point method of a .NET console app, and how should it be explicitly declared if you are not using the top level program feature?
    . static void Main(string[] args)
    . a static void function called Main, with the parameter string array called args

7. what namespace is the program class defined in with a top level program?
    . I would imagine it would be null or global
    . You can still give a namespace when it is a top level program

8. where would you look for help for a c# keyword?
    . You can either use the lookup tool or use the command line argument to pull up the help in either the web or in the command line

9. where would you look first for solutions to common programming problems?
    . I would either look on stackoverflow, geeks for geeks or github
    . stackoverflow seems to be the best one of the options & can be used by copilot as training data

10. what should you do after getting AI to write code for you?
    . Before just accepting it into your code space, you should go through it line by line 
    . You should do this to make sure it is absolutely what you want & to see if you could manually do it better or refactor this code
    . Then you shoould either accept or reject this code suggestion 
    . In my opinion, when learning via code wars or personal projects, it's best left off as imo it makes self learning alot slower and you end up using it as a crutch
